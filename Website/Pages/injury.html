<p><b>Injury</b>, also known as <b>physical trauma</b>, is damage to the body caused by an external force. This may be caused by <a href='accident.html'>accident</a>s, falls, hits, weapons, and other causes. Major trauma is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged <a href='disability.html'>disability</a> or death.
In 2013, 4.8 million people world-wide died from injuries, up from 4.3 million in 1990. More than 30% of these deaths were tran<a href='sport.html'>sport</a>-related injuries. In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990. Injuries are the cause of 9% of all deaths, and are the sixth-leading cause of death in the world.</p>

<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by mechanism of injury, objects/substances producing injury, place of occurrence, activity when injured, the role of human intent, and additional modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts.</p><p>The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by nature, part of body affected, source and secondary source, and event or exposure. The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since.</p><p>The Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System (OSIICS), previously OSICS, is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries.</p>

<h3>By cause</h3>
<p>Causes for injuries fall under two categories: <a href='intention.html'>intention</a>al and accidental. Intentional injuries include acts of violence and war, or be can self-imposed like suicide or self-harm. Accidental injuries can come from falling or motor <a href='vehicle.html'>vehicle</a> accidents. Some cases of accidental injuries are injury by stingray or lightning injuries.

<h3>By modality</h3>
<ul><li>Trauma
<ul><li>Traumatic injuries are a body <a href='wound.html'>wound</a> or shock produced by sudden physical collision or movement. Injuries associated with trauma are avulsion, bone fracture, injury by blast, internal bleeding and catastrophic injuries.</li></ul></li>
<li>Strain, repetitive strain, or sprain
<ul><li>Strain and repetitive strain are injuries to muscles or tendons. Sprain is an injury to a ligament or ligaments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Toxins
<ul><li>Injury from toxin or as adverse effect of a pharmaceutical drug.</li></ul></li>
<li>Other external or internal injuries
<ul><li>Other injuries can be from external causes, such as radiation, <a href='burn.html'>burn</a> or frost<a href='bite.html'>bite</a>. These injuries can include radiation-induced lung injury and microwave burn. Injuries from internal causes include reperfusion injury.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3>Injury severity score</h3>
<p>The injury severity score (ISS) is a medical score to assess trauma severity. It correlates with mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term <i>major trauma</i> (polytrauma), recognized when the ISS is greater than 15. The AIS Committee of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine designed and updates the scale.
