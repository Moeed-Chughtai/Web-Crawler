<p><b>Ash</b> or <b>ashes</b> are the solid remnants of <a href='fire.html'>fire</a>s. Specifically, <i>ash</i> refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something burns. In analytical chemistry, to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples,  ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after complete combustion.
</p><p>Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion are mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, <a href='fireplace.html'>fireplace</a>s, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal from incomplete combustion. The ashes are of different types. Some ashes contain natural compounds that make soil fertile. Others have chemical compounds that can be toxic but may break up in soil from chemical changes and microorganism activity.
</p><p>Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as alternative when soap is not available.</p>

<h2>Natural occurrence</h2>
<p>Ash occurs naturally from any fire that burns <a href='vegetation.html'>vegetation</a>, and may disperse in the soil to fertilise it, or clump under it for long enough to carbonise into coal.
