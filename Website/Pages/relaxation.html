<p><b>Relaxation</b> stands quite generally for a release of tension, a return to equilibrium.

<p>In the sciences, the term is used in the following ways:
</p>
<ul><li>Relaxation (physics), and more in particular:
<ul><li>Relaxation (NMR), processes by which nuclear magnetization returns to the equilibrium distribution</li>
<li>Dielectric relaxation, the delay in the dielectric constant of a material</li>
<li>Vibrational energy relaxation, the process by which molecules in high energy quantum states return to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</li>
<li>Chemical relaxation methods, related to temperature jump</li>
<li>Relaxation oscillator, a type of electronic oscillator</li></ul></li></ul><p>In mathematics:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Relaxation (approximation), a technique for transforming hard constraints into easier ones</li>
<li>Relaxation (iterative method), a technique for the numerical solution of equations</li>
<li>Relaxation (extension method), a technique for a natural extension in mathematical optimization or variational problems</li></ul></dd></dl><p>In computer science:

</p>
<ul><li>Relaxation (psychology), the emotional state of low tension</li>
<li>Relaxation technique, an activity that helps a person to relax</li>
<li>Relaxation can induced using breathing techniques. Long exhalation creates a relaxed pose. Making the temple of head and the upper lips relaxed helps keep a relaxed state.</li></ul><p><br>
