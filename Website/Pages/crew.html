<p>A <b>crew</b> is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization. A location in which a crew works is called a <b>crewyard</b> or a <b>workyard</b>. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title <i>crewman</i> or <i>crew-member</i>.
</p><p><i>Crew</i> also refers to the <a href='sport.html'>sport</a> of rowing, where <a href='team.html'>team</a>s row competitively in racing shells.</p>
