<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>In wake of their escape from the walker-overrun prison, Tara (Alanna Masterson) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) are picked up by Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Eugene (Josh McDermitt) in their military vehicle as they drive north. After recovering from the past day, Glenn insists that Abraham stop so that they look for Maggie and other survivors from the prison. Abraham refuses, stating that he and Rosita are on a mission to bring Eugene to Washington D.C., as Eugene, a scientist, says he knows how to stop the walkers once there. Glenn and Abraham get into an argument, drawing a small group of walkers towards them. As they start to fire upon the walkers, Eugene fumbles with his weapon and accidentally shoots the truck's gas tank. With the walkers dealt with, they are forced to abandon the truck. Glenn and Tara head south to continue their search for other survivors from the prison; Abraham, Rosita, and Eugene decide to join them heading south until they are able to find a new vehicle.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Carl (Chandler Riggs), having regrouped in an abandoned home, are eating breakfast, when Michonne makes a comment about soy milk for their cereal; Carl replies he would rather have baby formula than soy milk, but this causes him to recall the apparent loss of his newborn sister Judith, and he leaves the table. Rick thanks Michonne for trying to help and being a friend to Carl. Later, Carl and Michonne decide to go on a supply run; Rick tries to come but Michonne orders him to get some rest to recover from his injuries. Rick goes to bed in an upstairs bedroom as they leave. Michonne and Carl bond more during their run, with Carl learning about Michonne's son Andre that she had lost in the apocalypse. In one house they come across a children's room where the family appeared to have committed suicide together. Recalling her son and her sad memories, Michonne blocks Carl's view of the room, though Carl offers that Judith and Andre are in heaven together.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Rick is woken by noises in the house, discovering a small band of scavengers are inside. He hides under the bed as one, Tony (Davi Jay) takes a nap on it. Another scavenger, Len (Marcus Hester), demands Tony give up the bed, having no claim to it. The two get into a fight, during which Tony spots Rick under the bed. Before Tony can issue a warning, Len knocks him unconscious and then falls asleep. Rick sneaks out when the other scavengers shout on discovering signs of Michonne's freshly washed clothes, believe a woman to be nearby. Rick is trying to flee the house but he gets discovered by another scavenger, Lou, in the bathroom. In order to stay hidden and undetected by the other members of the group, Rick quickly fights Lou and begins strangling him. Although Lou attempts to grab a pair of scissors on the nearby counter to stab Rick with, Rick ultimately strangles him to death before escaping out the window. Rick climbs out from the house to try to sneak away but his path is blocked by Joe (Jeff Kober), their lookout. As he spots Michonne and Carl returning, Rick is about to make a distraction when shouts from inside, due to Lou having become a walker, draw Joe's attention away, allowing Rick to run and warn Michonne and Carl away.
</p><p>The three continue travelling and encounter a sign near railroad tracks, stating that "sanctuary for all" lies down the ways of the train tracks.
