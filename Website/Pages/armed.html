<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Armed was sired by the great stakes winner Bull Lea, the sire of Citation.  His dam was Armful, whose sire was Belmont Stakes winner Chance Shot and whose grandsire was the great Fair Play.
</p><p>Besides being small for his age and very headstrong, Armed had the habits of biting and kicking hay out of his handler's pitchfork. Since he was also practically untrainable, his trainer, Ben A. Jones, sent him back to Calumet Farm to be gelded and turned out to grow up.  He returned to the track late in his two-year-old season and resumed training.
