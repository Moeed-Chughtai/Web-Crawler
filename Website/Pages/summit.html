<p>A <b>summit</b> is a point on a surface that is higher in <a href='elevation.html'>elevation</a> than all points immediately adjacent to it. The topographic terms <b>acme</b>, <b>apex</b>, <b>peak</b> (<b>mountain peak</b>), and <b>zenith</b> are synonymous.
</p><p>The term <b><span><span id="top"></span><span>top</span></span></b> (<b>mountain top</b>) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered <i>subsummits</i> (or <i>subpeaks</i>) of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top. <i>Summit</i> may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.
</p><p>The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8848.86 m above sea level (29,032 ft). The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. They reached the mountain's peak in 1953.</p><p>Whether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. The UIAA definition of a peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres (98 ft) or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres (980 ft). Otherwise, it's a subpeak.
</p>

<p>In many parts of the western United States, the term <i>summit</i> can also be used for the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad, more commonly referred to as a <i>pass</i>. For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit. This can lead to confusion as to whether a labeled "summit" is a pass or a peak.
