<p>A <b>picnic</b> is a <a href='meal.html'>meal</a> taken outdoors (<i>al fresco</i>) as part of an excursion, especially in scenic surroundings, such as a <a href='park.html'>park</a>, lakeside, or other place affording an interesting view, or else in conjunction with a public event such as preceding an open-air theater performance, and usually in summer.
</p><p>Picnics are usually meant for the late mornings or midday, but could also be held later in the day. Descriptions of picnics show that the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed and was enjoyed out-of-doors was essential to a picnic from the early 19th century.</p><p>Picnics are often family-oriented but can also be an intimate occasion between two people or a large get-together such as company picnics and church picnics or clubs and community get togethers or of community care units. It is also sometimes combined with a cookout, usually a form of barbecue: either grilling (griddling, gridironing, or charbroiling), braising (by combining a charbroil or gridiron grill with a broth-filled pot), baking, or a combination of all of the above.
</p><p>On romantic and family picnics, a picnic basket and a blanket (to sit or recline on) are usually brought along. Outdoor games or some other form of entertainment are common at large picnics.  In established public parks, a <b>picnic area</b> generally includes picnic tables and possibly other items related to eating outdoors, such as built-in grills, water faucets, garbage containers, and restrooms.
</p><p>Some picnics are a potluck, an entertainment at which each person contributed some dish to a common table for all to share. When the picnic is not also a cookout, the food eaten is rarely hot, instead taking the form of deli sandwiches, finger food, fresh fruit, salad, cold meats and accompanied by chilled wine or champagne or soft drinks.

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word comes from the French word <i>pique-nique</i>, whose earliest usage in print is in the 1692 edition of Tony Willis, <i>Origines de la Langue Française</i>, which mentions <i>pique-nique</i> as being of recent origin. The term was used to describe a group of people dining in a restaurant who brought their own wine. The concept of a picnic long retained the connotation of a meal to which everyone contributed something. According to some dictionaries, the French word <i>pique-nique</i> is based on the verb <i>piquer</i>, which means 'pick', 'peck', or 'nab', and the rhyming addition <i>nique</i>, which means 'thing of little importance', 'bagatelle', 'trifle', but for example the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> says it is of unknown origin.</p><p>The French Revolution popularized the picnic across the world. French aristocrats fled to other Western countries, bringing their picnicking traditions with them. After the Revolution, French people of all classes visited and mingled in the country's royal parks. Picnicking transformed from an upper class luxury to a cheap way to spend an afternoon with friends.
</p><p>The word <i>picnic</i> first appeared in English in a letter from Lord Chesterfield in 1748 (<i>OED</i>), who associates it with card-playing, drinking, and conversation. Dictionaries agree it entered the English language as a respelling of the French word <i>pique-nique</i>. The practice of an elegant meal eaten out-of-doors, rather than an agricultural worker's d<a href='inn.html'>inn</a>er in a field, was connected with respite from hunting from the Middle Ages; the excuse for the pleasurable outing of 1723 in François Lemoyne's painting (<i>illustration, left</i>) is still offered in the context of a hunt.
</p><p>Black American communities have long believed there to be a link between the word picnic and lynching parties. This false etymology claims that the term <i>picnic</i> referred to the "picking" of a "nigger" to lynch.</p>

<h2>Related historical events</h2>
<p>After the French Revolution in 1789, royal parks became open to the public for the first time. Picnicking in the parks became a popular activity amongst the newly enfranchised citizens.
</p><p>Early in the 19th century, a fashionable group of Londoners formed the 'Picnic Society'. Members met in the Pantheon on Oxford Street. Each member was expected to provide a share of the entertainment and of the refreshments with no one particular host. Interest in the society waned in the 1850s as the founders died.</p><p>From the 1830s, Romantic American landscape painting of spectacular scenery often included a group of picnickers in the foreground. An early American illustration of the picnic is Thomas Cole's <i>The Pic-Nic</i> of 1846 (Brooklyn Museum of Art). In it, a guitarist serenades the genteel social group in the Hudson River Valley with the Catskills visible in the distance. Cole's well-<a href='dress.html'>dress</a>ed young picnickers having finished their repast, served from splint baskets on blue-and-white china, stroll about in the woodland and boat on the lake.
</p><p>The image of picnics as a peaceful social activity can be used for political protest, too. In this context, a picnic functions as a temporary occupation of significant public territory. A famous example of this is the Pan-European Picnic held on both sides of the Hungarian/Austrian border on 19 August 1989 as part of the struggle towards German reunification.
</p><p>In 2000, a 600-mile-long picnic took place from coast to coast in France to celebrate the first Bastille Day of the new Millennium.
