<p><i><b>Were</b></i> and <i><b>wer</b></i> are archaic terms for adult male humans and were often used for alliteration with wife as "were and wife" in Germanic-speaking cultures (Old English: <span title="Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">wer</i></span>, Old Dutch: <i lang="odt">wer</i>, Gothic: <span lang="got">waír</span>, Old Frisian: <i lang="ofs">wer</i>, Old Saxon: <i lang="osx">wer</i>, Old High German: <i lang="goh">wer</i>, Old Norse: <i lang="non">verr</i>).
</p><p>In Anglo-Saxon law <i>wer</i> was the value of a man's life. He could be required to pay his <i>wer</i> to the king as a penalty for crime. If he was murdered then his relatives were entitled to his wergild as compensation from the murderer.
</p>

<h2>Etymology and usage</h2>
<p>The word has cognates in various other languages, for example, the words <i><span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">vir</i></span></i> (as in virility) and <i><span title="Irish-language text"><i lang="ga">fear</i></span></i> (plural <i><span title="Irish-language text"><i lang="ga">fir</i></span></i> as in Fir Bolg) are the Latin and Gaelic for a male human.
</p><p>While this prefix may not be derived from the above word, in folklore and fantasy fiction, <i>were-</i> is often used as a prefix applied to an <a href='animal.html'>animal</a> name to indicate a type of therianthropic figure or shapeshifter (<i>e.g.</i> "were-boar"). Hyphenation used to be mandatory, but is now commonly dropped, as in werecat and wererat. This usage can be seen as a back-formation from <i>werewolf</i> (literally, "man-wolf"), as there is no equivalent <i>wifwolf</i> or <i>wyfwolf</i> yet attested.
