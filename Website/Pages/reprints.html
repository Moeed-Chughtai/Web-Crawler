<p>In academic publishing, offprints, sometimes also known as reprints, are bulk reproductions of individual articles previously published in academic journals. Offprints from scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journals are used by researchers in some fields to generate awareness among audiences who don't subscribe to the journal e.g. physicians, consumers, investors etc. They are usually ordered directly from the publisher of the journal. However, some third-party service providers also exist, serving as an intermediary that provides a single source of offprints from multiple publishers.
