<p>A <b>calculation</b> is a deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.
</p><p>For example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Estimating the fair price for financial instruments using the Black–Scholes model is a more complex algorithmic calculation.
</p><p>Statistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers.
</p><p>To <i>calculate</i> means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using logic, reason or common sense. The English word derives from the Latin <i>calculus</i>, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin <i>calx</i>). It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin <i>abacus</i>, Greek <i>abax</i>). The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the slide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars.

<h2>Comparison to computation</h2>
<p>Calculation is a prerequisite for computation. The difference in the meaning of <i>calculation</i> and <i>computation</i> appears to originate from the late medieval period.</p>
