<h2>Premise</h2>
<p><i>Coupled</i> features 12 single women who are on the quest for love. Each week different men come to the Caribbean Island and meet the women. After meeting, the women have the choice to go right — saying yes to pursuing the man some more — and join him at the Tiki bar.  Alternately, they can choose to go left — saying no to spending any more time with the man — and go back to the bungalow to wait for the next contestant. This process is inspired by the app, Tinder, in which you swipe left or right depending on your preference.</p><p>The women who choose to go to the tiki bar will await the man, where he will then pick two women to pursue further at the villa. Once at the villa, the man will spend some individual time with each of the women to see which one he has the most chemistry or connections with. At the end of the night, he will select one of the women to stay with him at the villa becoming <i>Coupled</i> and the other one will go back to the bungalow to await the next guy.
</p><p>At the end of their six-week stay on Anguilla, the couples will be faced with the decision to continue their relationship back in the United States or to end it. The women who want to continue the relationship will join their partner waiting for them at a helicopter pad, while the women who do not want to continue the relationship will not join the men.</p><p>During the show, the contestants are given cell phones which they can use to interact with each other. Some of the text messages are featured on the show to create a dialogue and convey more drama.</p>
