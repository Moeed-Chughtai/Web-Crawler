<p><b>Donald</b> is a masculine given name derived from the Gaelic name <i>Dòmhnall</i>. This comes from the Proto-Celtic *<i>Dumno-ualos</i> ("world-ruler" or "world-wielder"). The final -<i>d</i> in <i>Donald</i> is partly derived from a misinterpretation of the Gaelic pronunciation by English speakers, and partly associated with the spelling of similar-sounding Germanic names, such as <i>Ronald</i>. A short form of <i>Donald</i> is <i>Don</i>. Pet forms of <i>Donald</i> include <i>Donnie</i> and <i>Donny</i>. The feminine given name <i>Donella</i> is derived from <i>Donald</i>.</p><p><i>Donald</i> has cognates in other Celtic languages: Modern Irish <i>Dónal</i> (anglicised as <i>Donal</i> and <i>Donall</i>); Scottish Gaelic  <i>Dòmhnall</i>, <i>Domhnull</i> and <i>Dòmhnull</i>; Welsh <i>Dyfnwal</i> and Cumbric <i>Dumnagual</i>. Although the feminine given name <i>Donna</i> is sometimes used as a feminine form of <i>Donald</i>, the names are not etymologically related.</p>
