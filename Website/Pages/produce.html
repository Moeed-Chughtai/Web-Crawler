<p><b>Produce</b> is a generalized term for many <a href='farm.html'>farm</a>-produced <a href='crop.html'>crop</a>s, including <a href='fruit.html'>fruit</a>s and vegetables (grains, oats, etc. are also sometimes considered <i>produce</i>). More specifically, the term <i>produce</i> often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were <a href='harvest.html'>harvest</a>ed.
</p><p>In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept. <i>Produce</i> is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets. The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries.
</p><p>In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small <a href='sticker.html'>sticker</a>s bearing price look-up codes. These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.

<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Vegetables are optimally stored between 0° and 4.4° Celsius (32° and 40 °F) to reduce respiration. Generally, vegetables should be stored at a high humidity (80 and 95 percent relative humidity), but cucurbits (squash family) and onions prefer dry and can mold when moisture is high.</p>

<h2>Bacterial contamination</h2>
<p>Raw sprouts are among the produce most at risk of bacterial infection.</p><p>Rinsing is an effective way to reduce the bacteria count on produce, reducing it to about 10 percent of its previous level.</p><p>Wastewater used on vegetables can be a source of contamination, due to contamination with fecal matter, salmonella or other bacteria. After Denmark eliminated salmonella in its chickens, attention has turned to vegetables as a source of illness due to feces contamination from other animal sources, such as pigs.</p>
