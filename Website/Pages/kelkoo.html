In September of the same year, Kelkoo merged with Norway-based Zoomit.com, paying the Zoomit-shareholders in shares amounting to a third of Kelkoo's total equity making Zoomit.com the largest entity within "new" Kelkoo.</p><p>In June 2003, the company partnered with the European arm of the Microsoft site MSN to provide shopping listings. A similar deal was announced in June 2004 with Ask.com (formerly Ask Jeeves).

Inc to the private equity firm Jamplant Ltd.</p><p>In October 2016, Kelkoo acquired LeGuide group, the price comparison market leader in France.
