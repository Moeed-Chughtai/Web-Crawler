<p>A <b>soldier</b> is a person who is a member of an army. A soldier can be a conscripted or volunteer enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer.
</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word <i>soldier</i> derives from the Middle English word <span title="Middle English (1100-1500)-language text"><i lang="enm">soudeour</i></span>, from Old French <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">soudeer</i></span> or <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">soudeour</i></span>, meaning mercenary, from <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">soudee</i></span>, meaning shilling's worth or wage, from <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">sou</i></span> or <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">soud</i></span>, shilling. The word is also related to the Medieval Latin <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">soldarius</i></span>, meaning soldier (literally, "one having pay"). These words ultimately derive from the Late Latin word <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">solidus</i></span>, referring to an Ancient Roman coin used in the Byzantine Empire.</p>

<h2>Occupational designations</h2>
<p>In most armies use of the word "soldier" has taken on a more general meaning due to the increasing specialization of <a href='military.html'>military</a> occupations that require different areas of knowledge and skill-sets. As a result, "soldiers" are referred to by names or ranks which reflect an individual's military occupation specialty arm, service, or branch of military employment, their type of unit, or operational employment or technical use such as: trooper, tanker (a member of tank crew), commando, dragoon, infantryman, guardian, artilleryman, paratrooper, grenadier, ranger, sniper, engineer, sapper, craftsman, signaller, medic, or a gunner.
</p><p>In many countries soldiers serving in specific occupations are referred to by terms other than their occupational name. For example, military police personnel in the British Army are known as "red caps" because of the colour of their caps (and berets).
</p><p>Infantry are sometimes called "grunts" (in the United States Army) or "squaddies" (in the British Army), while U.S. Army artillery crews, or "gunners," are sometimes referred to as "redlegs", from the service branch color for artillery. U.S. soldiers are often called "G.I.s" (short for the term "General Issue").
</p><p>French Marine Infantry are called marsouins (French: <i lang="fr">porpoises</i>) because of their amphibious role. Military units in most armies have nicknames of this type, arising either from items of distinctive uniform, some historical connotation or rivalry between branches or regiments.

<h2>Career and conscripted</h2>
<p>Some soldiers, such as conscripts or draftees, serve a single limited term. Others choose to serve until retirement; then they receive a pension and other benefits. In the United States, military members can get retirement pay after 20 years. In other countries, the term of service is 30 years, hence the term "30-year man".
