I used bongo drums in the track which I know my fans will relate to and instantly recognise. When I was working on the track I imagined it fitting snuggly into people’s intimate spaces.

I could see soul mates gleaming with joy as they remembered what they were doing the first time they heard it and how they felt.</p></blockquote>
