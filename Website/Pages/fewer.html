<p><b><i>Fewer</i> versus <i>less</i></b> is the debate revolving around grammatically using the use words <i>fewer</i> and <i>less</i> correctly. According to prescriptive grammar, <i>fewer</i> should be used (instead of <i>less</i>) with nouns for countable objects and concepts (discretely quantifiable nouns, or count nouns). According to this rule, <i>less</i> should be used only with a grammatically singular noun (including mass nouns). However, descriptive grammarians (who describe language as actually used) point out that this rule does not correctly describe the most common usage of today or the past and in fact arose as an incorrect generalization of a personal preference expressed by a grammarian in 1770.</p>

<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>This rule can be seen in the examples "there is less flour in this canister" and "there are fewer cups (grains, pounds, bags, etc.) of flour in this canister", which are based on the reasoning that flour is uncountable whereas the unit used to measure the flour (cup, etc.) is countable. However, some prescriptivists prescribe the rule addition that <i>less</i> should be used with units of measurement (e.g. "less than 10 pounds/dollars"). Prescriptivists might, however, consider "fewer cups of coffee" to be correct in a sentence such as "there are fewer cups of coffee on the table now", where the cups are countable separate objects. In addition, "less" is sometimes recommended in front of counting nouns that denote distance, amount, or time. For example, "we go on holiday in fewer than four weeks" and "he can run the 100 m in fewer than ten seconds" are not advised by some people.</p><p>Some prescriptivists argue that even the extremely rare and completely unidiomatic <i>one fewer</i> should be used instead of <i>one less</i> (both when used alone or together with a singular, discretely quantifiable noun as in "there is one fewer cup on this table"), but <i>Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage</i> clearly states that common usage dictates "one less" in all cases.</p>

<h2>Current usage</h2>
<p>The <a href='comparative.html'>comparative</a> <i>less</i> is used with both countable and uncountable nouns in some informal discourse environments and in most dialects of English. In other informal discourse however, the use of <i>fewer</i> could be considered natural. Many supermarket checkout line signs, for instance, will read "10 items or less"; others, however, will use <i>fewer</i> in an attempt to conform to prescriptive grammar. However, descriptive grammarians consider this to be a case of hypercorrection as explained in <i>Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage</i>. A British supermarket chain replaced its "10 items or less" notices at checkouts with "up to 10 items" to avoid the issue. It has also been noted that it is less common to favour "At fewest ten items" over "At least ten items" – a potential inconsistency in the "rule", and a study of online usage seems to suggest that the distinction may, in fact, be semantic rather than grammatical. Likewise, it would be very unusual to hear the unidiomatic "I have seen that film at fewest ten times."</p><p><i>The Cambridge Guide to English Usage</i> notes that the "pressure to substitute <i>fewer</i> for <i>less</i> seems to have developed out of all proportion to the ambiguity it may provide in noun phrases like <i>less promising results</i>". It describes conformance with this pressure as a shibboleth and the choice "between the more formal <i>fewer</i> and the more spontaneous <i>less</i>" as a stylistic choice.</p>

<h2>Historical usage</h2>
<p><i>Less</i> has always been used in English with countable nouns. Indeed, the application of the distinction between <i>less</i> and <i>fewer</i> as a rule is a phenomenon originating in the 18th century. On this, <i>Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage</i> notes:</p>
<dl><dd>As far as we have been able to discover, the received rule originated in 1770 as a comment on <i>less</i>: "This Word is most commonly used in speaking of a Number; where I should think <i>Fewer</i> would do better. 'No Fewer than a Hundred' appears to me, not only more elegant than 'No less than a Hundred', but more strictly proper." (Robert Baker 1770). Baker's remarks about 'fewer' express clearly and modestly – 'I should think,' 'appears to me' – his own taste and preference....Notice how Baker's preference has been generalized and elevated to an absolute status and his notice of contrary usage has been omitted."</dd></dl><p>The oldest use that the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> gives for <i>less</i> with a countable noun is a quotation from 888 by Alfred the Great:
</p>
<dl><dd><i><span title="Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">Swa mid <strong>læs worda</strong> swa mid ma, swæðer we hit yereccan mayon.</i></span></i></dd></dl><dl><dd>("With <strong>less words</strong> or with more, whether we may prove it.")</dd></dl><p>This is in fact an Old English partitive construction using the "quasi-substantive" adverb <i><span title="Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">læs</i></span></i> and the genitive <i><span title="Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">worda</i></span></i> ("less of words") (cf. plenty of words and *plenty words). When the genitive plural ceased to exist, <i>less of words</i> became <i>less words</i>, and this construction has been used since then until the present.</p>
