<h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p>Philip Sherburne of <i>Pitchfork</i> stated that <i>Worldwide Angel</i> "largely sticks to the template established on previous Bad Gyal songs: synth-heavy, sticky-sweet dembow grooves tinged with airy melancholy", and "is clearly meant to signal [her] arrival as a global force." Sherburne found her melodies "often about as emphatic as a shrug", and noted that her lyrics "seem hesitant to stray far from themes she's already explored."</p>
