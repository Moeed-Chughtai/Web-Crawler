<h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p><i>Identified</i> has received generally favorable reviews, having a 63 "metascore" based on 7 reviews. <i>Billboard</i> said that the album "panders to the preteen demo with stop-start pop that ranges from pleasant (the title track) to dull ("Amazed") to off-putting ("Hook It Up"). But for little girls, this is one nonstop sing-along." <i>The New York Times</i> said that "a handful of songs like this would have sufficed to help mature her image, and yet "Identified" is far more interesting and unexpected."</p><p><i>Blender</i> gave it a three stars out of five, and claimed that her "voice was made to rip, and when she lets go just a little, the coyness turns sultry—proof that she might just have a life after high school." <i>Variety</i> said that <i>Identified</i> "shows that the <i>High School Musical</i> veteran is definitely ready to graduate. The better parts of the album find her reaching for a more mature sound, but she hedges her bets with large portions of treacly teen-pop...The weakest link in most of the songs is Hudgens thin, piping voice."</p>
