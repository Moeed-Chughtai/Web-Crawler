<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word <i>official</i> as a noun has been recorded since the Middle English period, first seen in 1314. It comes from the Old French <i>official</i> (12th century), from the Latin <i>officialis</i> ("attendant to a magistrate, government  official"), the noun use of the original adjective <i>officialis</i> ("of or belonging to duty, service, or office") from <i>officium</i> ("office"). The meaning "person in charge of some public work or duty" was first recorded in 1555. The adjective is first attested in English in 1533 via the Old French <i><span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">oficial</i></span></i>. The informal term <i>officialese</i>, the jargon of "officialdom", was first recorded in 1884.
</p>

<h2>Roman antiquity</h2>
<p>An <i>officialis</i> (plural <i>officiales</i>) was the official term (somewhat comparable to a modern civil servant) for any member of the officium (staff) of a high dignitary such as a governor.
</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical judiciary</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1045330069"><p>In Canon law, the word or its Latin original <i><b>officialis</b></i> is used absolutely as the legal title of a diocesan bishop's judicial vicar who shares the bishop's ordinary judicial power over the diocese and presides over the diocesan ecclesiastical court.
</p><p>The 1983 Code of Canon Law gives precedence to the title Judicial Vicar, rather than that of Officialis (canon 1420). The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches uses only the title Judicial Vicar (canon 191).
</p><p>In German, the related noun <i>Offizialat</i> was also used for an official bureau in a diocese that did much of its administration, comprising the vicariate-general, an adjoined secretariat, a registry office and a chancery.
</p><p>In Catholicism, the vicar-general was originally called the "official" (<i>officialis</i>).</p><p>The title of <b>official principal</b>, together with that of vicar-general, has in Anglicanism been merged in that of Diocesan chancellor of a diocese.</p>

<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>In <a href='sports.html'>sports</a>, the term official is used to describe a person enforcing playing rules in the capacity of a linesman, referee and umpire; also specified by the discipline, e.g. American football official, ice hockey official. An official competition is created or recognized as valid by the competent body, is agreed to or arranged by people in positions of authority. Is synonymous, among others, with approved, certified, recognized, endorsed, legitimate.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>The term <i>officer</i> is close to being a synonym (but has more military connotations). A <b>functionary</b> is someone who carries out a particular role within an organization; this again is quite a close synonym for <i><b>official</b></i>, as a noun, but with connotations closer to bureaucrat. Any such person acts in their <b>official capacity</b>, in carrying out the duties of their office; they are also said to <b>officiate</b>, for example in a ceremony. A <b>public official</b> is an official of central or local government.
</p>

<h2>Max Weber on bureaucratic officials</h2>
<p>Max Weber gave as definition of a bureaucratic official:
</p>
<ul><li>they are personally free and appointed to their position on the basis of conduct</li>
<li>he exercises the authority delegated to them in accordance with impersonal rules, and their loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of their official duties</li>
<li>their appointment and job placement are dependent upon their technical qualifications</li>
<li>their administrative work is a full-time occupation</li>
<li>their work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.</li></ul><p>An official must exercise their judgment and their skills, but their duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority; ultimately they are responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice their personal judgment if it runs counter to their official duties.
</p>

<h2>Adjective</h2>
