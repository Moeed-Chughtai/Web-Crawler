<p>A <b>jacket</b> is a garment for the upper body, usually extending below the hips. A jacket typically has sleeves, and fastens in the front or slightly on the side. A jacket is generally lighter, tighter-fitting, and less insulating than a coat, which is outerwear. Some jackets are fashionable, while others serve as protective <a href='clothing.html'>clothing</a>. Jackets without sleeves are vests.
