<p>In law, a <b>conviction</b> is the verdict that usually results when a court of law finds a <a href='defendant.html'>defendant</a> guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, "not guilty"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases in which the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand the mechanism for this is a discharge.
</p><p>For a host of reasons, the criminal justice system is not perfect:  sometimes guilty defendants are acquitted, while innocent people are convicted. Appeal mechanisms and post conviction relief procedures may mitigate the effects of a conviction to some extent. An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice.
</p><p>After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a <a href='punishment.html'>punishment</a>. Furthermore, the conviction may lead to results beyond the terms of the sentence itself. Such ramifications are known as the collateral consequences of criminal charges.
</p><p>A <b>minor conviction</b> is a warning conviction, and it does not affect the defendant but does serve as a warning.</p><p>A history of convictions are called antecedents, known colloquially as "previous" in the United Kingdom, and "priors" in the United States and Australia. The history of convictions also shows that a minor law conviction can be prosecuted as any individual's punishment.
