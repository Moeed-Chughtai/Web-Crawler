</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>The most common type of memorial is the gravestone or the memorial plaque. Also common are war memorials commemorating those who have died in wars. Memorials in the form of a cross are called intending crosses.
</p><p>Online memorials are often created on <a href='websites.html'>websites</a> and social media to allow digital access as an alternative to physical memorials which may not be feasible or easily accessible.
</p><p>When somebody has died, the family may request that a memorial gift (usually <a href='money.html'>money</a>) be given to a designated charity, or that a tree be planted in memory of the person. Those temporary or makeshift memorials are also called grassroots memorials.</p><p>Sometimes, when a student has died, the memorials are placed in the form of a <a href='scholarship.html'>scholarship</a>, to be awarded to high-achieving students in future years.
</p><p>Memorials to persons or events of major significance may be designated as <i>national memorials</i>.
