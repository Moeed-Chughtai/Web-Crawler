<h2>History</h2>
<p>Binary Compass Enterprises, the original name for what would later become Bizrate, was founded in June 1996, by classmates, at the University of California Los Angeles and Wharton School of Business, Farhad Mohit and Henri Asseily.  The pair used a school project they authored while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania as the basis for their original model of a research company.</p><p>The first retailer reviews were collected in 1997 after launching and rebranding the website as Bizrate.com.  Services were later expanded to include comparison shopping.</p><p>In August 1999, during the earlier days of online shopping, Bizrate partnered with Consumer Reports to provide retailer ratings and research in both the print and online editions of the Consumer Reports Magazine.  During this year, Bizrate also launched its "Don't get e-screwed campaign", bringing the site to the forefront as the place to find reliable feedback from other customers.</p><p>In 2004, Bizrate rebranded to Shopzilla, reflecting consumers’ increased focus on price comparison, and launched Shopzilla.com.  During this time, the ratings and reviews side of the business was also rebranded to Bizrate Insights in order to maintain a clear definition of services.  Bizrate Insights continued to provide retailer ratings and reviews to both Bizrate.com and Shopzilla.com.  In 2010, Bizrate Insights formed a partnership with Google to begin distributing retailer ratings and reviews from Bizrate Insights to Google Product Search and Google AdWords ads. Since then, this has been expanded to include syndication to a number of partners across the internet.
