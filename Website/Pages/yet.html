<p><b>Yet</b> is a common English word that, when used as a conjunction, is equivalent to the words "but" or "nevertheless".
</p><p>However, used as an adverb, <i>yet</i> defines an action's persistence in time. The word can define an action in the past, present or future:
</p>
<ul><li><i>I have never <b>yet</b> been late.</i></li>
<li><i>I <b>yet</b> stand.</i></li>
<li><i>I will <b>yet</b> arrive.</i></li></ul><p>"yet" in questions:
</p>
<ul><li><i>What do you have <b>yet</b> to learn?</i>  (in the future)</li>
<li><i>Have you done it <span><s>yet</s></span>?</i>  &lt;=&gt;  <i>Have you <b>already</b> done it?</i>   (in the past)</li></ul><p>The above use of "<span>yet</span>" is illogical, but very common and thus considered correct.
</p><p><b>Yet</b>, or <b>YET</b>, may also refer to:
</p>
<ul><li>YET, the IATA code for Edson Airport, Alberta, Canada</li>
<li>YET, the National Rail code for Yetminster railway station in Dorset, UK</li>
<li>"Yet" (song) by the American band Exile</li>
