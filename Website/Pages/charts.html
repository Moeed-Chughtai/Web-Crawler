<p>A <b>chart</b> is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which "the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart". A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info.
</p><p>The term "chart" as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings:
</p>
<ul><li>A data chart is a type of <a href='diagram.html'>diagram</a> or graph, that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data.</li>
<li>Maps that are adorned with extra information (<a href='map.html'>map</a> surround) for a specific purpose are often known as charts, such as a nautical chart or aeronautical chart, typically spread over several map sheets.</li>
<li>Other domain-specific constructs are sometimes called charts, such as the chord chart in music notation or a record chart for album popularity.</li></ul><p>Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as "satisfied, not satisfied, unsure") are often displayed in a pie chart, but maybe more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart. On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as "annual revenue from 1990 to 2000") might be best shown as a line chart.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>A chart can take a large variety of forms. However, there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data.
</p><p>Typically the data in a chart is represented graphically since humans can infer meaning from pictures more quickly than from text. Thus, the text is generally used only to annotate the data.
</p><p>One of the most important uses of text in a graph is the <b>title</b>. A graph's title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to.
</p><p>Dimensions in the data are often displayed on <b>axes</b>. If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used, they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis. Each axis will have a <b>scale</b>, denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications. Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it, briefly describing the dimension represented. If the scale is numerical, the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses. For example, "Distance traveled (m)" is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled, in units of meters, is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart.
</p><p>Within the graph, a <b>grid</b> of lines may appear to aid in the visual alignment of data. The grid can be enhanced by visually emphasizing the lines at regular or significant graduations. The emphasized lines are then called major gridlines, and the remainder is minor grid lines.
</p><p>A chart's data can appear in all manner of formats and may include individual textual <b>labels</b> describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart. The data may appear as dots or shapes, connected or unconnected, and in any combination of colors and patterns. In addition, inferences or points of interest can be overlaid directly on the graph to further aid information extraction.
</p><p>When the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables, the chart may include a <b>legend</b> (also known as a <b>key</b>). A legend contains a list of the variables appearing in the chart and an example of their appearance. This information allows the data from each variable to be identified in the chart.

<h3>Common charts</h3>
<p>Four of the most common charts are:

</ul><p>This gallery shows:
</p>
<ul><li>A histogram consists of tabular frequencies, shown as adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval; first introduced by Karl Pearson.</li>
<li>A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. The first known bar charts are usually attributed to Nicole Oresme, Joseph Priestley, and William Playfair.</li>
<li>A pie chart shows percentage values as a slice of a pie; first introduced by William Playfair.</li>
<li>A line chart is a two-dimensional scatterplot of ordered observations where the observations are connected following their order. The first known line charts are usually credited to Francis Hauksbee, Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius, Johann Heinrich Lambert and William Playfair.</li></ul><p>Other common charts are:

<li>A waterfall chart also known as a "Walk" chart, is a special type of floating-column chart.</li>

<h2>Chart software</h2>
<p>While charts can be drawn by hand, computer software is often used to automatically produce a chart based on entered data. For examples of commonly used software tools, see List of charting software.
