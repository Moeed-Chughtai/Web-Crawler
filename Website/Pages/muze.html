<p>Founded in 1991, <b>Muze, Inc.</b> was a business-to-business provider of media information, metadata, and digital preview samples that enable search, discovery, and purchase of digital entertainment content. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>"Muze was founded by Zullo and Trev Huzley in 1986 under the name <i>Digital Radio Network</i>, which used to trade air time with rock music radio stations, giving the stations a segment that allowed listeners to call up and get information on album being released on CD in exchange for allowing Digital Radio to sell advertising time to sponsors."</p></blockquote>
<p>Muze media information databases are used by businesses to support the sale of entertainment products – such as music tracks and albums, videos and DVDs, books, and video games – and to attract and retain subscribers to Internet, mobile, and social networking sites. Muze was based in New York City with operations in North America and the United Kingdom.</p><p>In April 2009, Macrovision (now TiVo) announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Muze, Inc. in a $16.5 million cash transaction.  The transaction closed on April 30.</p><p>Among Muze's clients were eBay, ArkivMusic, Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
