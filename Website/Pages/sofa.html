<p>A <b>couch</b>, also known as a <b>sofa</b>, <b>settee</b>, or <b>chesterfield</b> (see Etymology below), is a cushioned item of furniture for seating multiple people (although it is not uncommon for a single person to use a couch). It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows. Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping. In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den or lounge, or wherever couches are best appreciated. They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as <a href='hotel.html'>hotel</a>s, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars. Couches can also vary in size, color, and design.

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The term <i>couch</i> originally denoted an item of furniture for lying or sleeping on.  <i>Couch</i> is predominantly used in North America, Australia, South Africa, and Ireland, whereas the terms <i>sofa</i> and <i>settee</i> (U and non-U) are most commonly used in the United Kingdom and India. The word <i>couch</i> originated in Middle English from the Old French noun <i><span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">couche</i></span></i>, which derived from the verb meaning "to lie down". The word <i>sofa</i> comes from Persian and is derived from the Arabic word <i><span title="Arabic-language romanization"><i lang="ar-Latn">suffah</i></span></i> ("ledge/bench"), cognates with the Aramaic word <i><span title="Aramaic-language text"><i lang="arc">sippa</i></span></i> ("<a href='mat.html'>mat</a>").</p><p>The word <i>settee</i> or <i>setee</i> comes from the Old English word <i><span title="Old English (ca. 450-1100)-language text"><i lang="ang">setl</i></span></i>, which was used to describe long benches with high backs and arms, but is now generally used to describe upholstered seating.</p><p>Other terms which can be synonymous with the above definition are <i>chesterfield</i> (Canada), <i>divan</i>, <i>davenport</i>, <i>lounge</i>, and <i>canapé</i>.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>The most common types of couches include the two-seater, sometimes referred to as a loveseat, and the sofa. The loveseat is designed for seating two people, while the sofa has more than two cushion seats. A sectional sofa, often just referred to as a "sectional", is formed from multiple sections (typically two, three, and four) and usually includes at least two pieces which join at an angle of 90 degrees or slightly greater. Sectional sofas are used to wrap around walls or other furniture.
</p><p>Other variants include the divan, the fainting couch (backless or partial-backed) and the canapé (an ornamental three-seater). To conserve space, some sofas double as beds in the form of sofa beds, daybeds, or futons.
</p>

<p>A furniture set consisting of a sofa with two matching <a href='chair.html'>chair</a>s is known as a "chesterfield suite" or "living-room suite". In the UK, the word <i>chesterfield</i> was used to refer to any couch in the 1900s. A chesterfield now describes a deep buttoned sofa, usually made from leather, with arms and back of the same height. The first chesterfield, with its distinctive deep buttoned, quilted leather upholstery and lower seat base, was commissioned by Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield (1694–1773).
</p><p>In Canadian English, <i>chesterfield</i> is used to describe any couch or sofa, particularly among older Canadians. According to a 1992 survey conducted in the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, the term is quickly vanishing.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>A couch consists of the frame, springs, padding, and covering. The frame is usually made of wood, but can also be made of steel, plastic or laminated boards. Sofa padding is made from foam, down, feathers, fabric or a combination thereof. Sofa coverings are usually made out of soft leather, corduroy or linen. Couches commonly have springs under the padding for more support, although some dont.
