<p><b>Rescue</b> comprises responsive operations that usually involve the saving of life, or the urgent treatment of injuries after an accident or a dangerous situation.
</p><p>Tools used might include search and rescue dogs, mounted search and rescue horses, helicopters, the "jaws of life", and other hydraulic cutting and spreading <a href='tool.html'>tool</a>s used to extricate individuals from wrecked <a href='vehicle.html'>vehicle</a>s.  Rescue operations are sometimes supported by rescue vehicles operated by rescue squads.
</p><p>Rescues, sometimes of a damsel in distress, are a common theme in fiction. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of "rescue fantasies" by men of "fallen women" in his 1910 work "A Special Type of Choice of Object Made by Men". The term has evolved to refer to therapists' desire to 'rescue' their clients.</p>
