<p>An <b>editorial</b> (US), <b>leading article</b> or <b>leader</b> (UK) is an article written by the senior editorial people or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Boston Globe</i>, often classify editorials under the heading "opinion".
</p><p>Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons.</p><p>Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on.</p><p>Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name <b>think pieces</b>) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication.  However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France.</p><p>Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. Tom Clark, leader-writer for <i>The Guardian</i>, says that it ensures readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author. On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.</p><p><span id="Photo-editorial"></span>
In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to <i>photo</i>-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.</p>
