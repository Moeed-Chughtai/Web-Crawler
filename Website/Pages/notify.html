<p>A <b>vertical service code</b> (<b>VSC</b>) is a sequence of digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) dialed on a telephone keypad vertical service code or rotary dial to enable or disable certain telephone service features. Some vertical service codes require dialing of a telephone number after the code sequence. On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name <i>star codes</i>. On rotary dial telephones, the star is replaced by dialing <i>11</i>.
</p><p>In North American telephony, VSCs were developed by AT&amp;T Corp. as <b>Custom Local Area Signaling Services</b> (<b>CLASS</b> or <b>LASS</b>) codes in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard. As <i>CLASS</i> was an AT&amp;T trademark, the term <i>vertical service code</i> was adopted by the North American Numbering Plan Administration. The use of <i>vertical</i> is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a local telephone subscriber, going up (<i>vertically</i>) inside the local central office instead of out (<i>horizontally</i>) to another telephone company.
