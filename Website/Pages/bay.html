<p>A <b>bay</b> is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or even another bay. A large bay is usually called a <a href='gulf.html'>gulf</a>, sea, sound, or bight. A <a href='cove.html'>cove</a> is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance. A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.
</p><p>A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary of the Susquehanna River. Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada. Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology.
</p><p>The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves. Bays may have as wide a variety of <a href='shore.html'>shore</a>line characteristics as other shorelines. In some cases, bays have beaches, which "are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace". Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for <a href='fishing.html'>fishing</a>. Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)  defines a bay as a well-marked indentation in the coastline, whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation however shall not be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as (or larger than) that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation — otherwise it would be referred to as a bight.

<h2>Formation</h2>
<p>There are various ways in which bays can form. The largest bays have developed through plate tectonics. As the super-continent Pangaea broke up along curved and indented fault lines, the continents moved apart and left large bays; these include the Gulf of Guinea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bay of Bengal, which is the world's largest bay.</p><p>Bays also form through coastal erosion by rivers and glaciers. A bay formed by a glacier is a fjord. Rias are created by rivers and are characterised by more gradual slopes. Deposits of softer rocks erode more rapidly, forming bays, while harder rocks erode less quickly, leaving headlands.
