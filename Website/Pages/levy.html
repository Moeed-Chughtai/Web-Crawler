<h2>Military organizations</h2>
<p>A <b>levy</b> (plural <b>levies</b>) is a military force raised ("levied") in a particular manner. In the Roman legion this typically means "farmer soldier" militia units raised by conscription that provided most of light and heavy infantry composition—most of which were of poor training and little fighting ability—but not always. In the British Empire, levies were units raised by local officials for local tasks, typically for local order and security.
