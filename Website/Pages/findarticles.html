The site offered free and paid content through the HighBeam Research database. In 2007, <i>FindArticles</i> accessed over 11 million resource articles, going back to 1998.</p><p>As it grew, <i>FindArticles</i> moved away from an all-free model driven by advertising to a mixture of free and paid content.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>2000–2007: Founding and growth</h3>
<p><i>FindArticles</i> was founded in 2000 as a partnership between LookSmart, which authored the search technology, and the Gale Group, which provided the articles for a fee.</p><p>By early-August 2000, the <i>FindArticles</i> database contained more than 862,000 articles and by September 2000, the database contained more than 1 million articles.</p><p>In September 2004, HighBeam Research announced that it would make 1 million premium articles from its database accessible via <i>FindArticles</i>. By May 2005, <i>FindArticles</i> contained more than 5 million articles in its database.</p><p>In November 2006, <i>FindArticles</i> reported over 17.6 million unique visitors to their site. In April 2007, LookSmart partnered with Blinkx to power <i>FindArticles</i>' video search results.</p>

<h3>2007–present: CNET purchase and CNET ownership</h3>
<p><i>FindArticles</i> remained a part of LookSmart throughout the various changes in that company until it was sold to CNET Networks for $20.5 million on November 9, 2007, as part of a larger sell-off of LookSmart properties.</p><p>Looksmart's need to offload non-critical assets in the wake of poor corporate performance, along with CNET's commensurate desire to expand its library of offerings, motivated the deal. <i>FindArticles'</i> SEO value—i.e., the frequency with which its articles appear as search engine results—likely factored into the final purchase price.</p><p><i>FindArticles</i> had been part of the BNET division of CNET Networks and is currently owned by CBS Interactive.</p>
