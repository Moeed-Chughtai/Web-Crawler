<p>A <b>locative adverb</b> is a type of adverb that refers to a location or to a combination of a location and a relation to that location. Generally, a locative adverb is semantically equivalent to a prepositional phrase involving a locative or directional preposition. In English, for example, <i>homeward</i> is a locative adverb, specifying a location "home" and a relation "toward" (in this case a direction), and is equivalent to the phrase "toward home". The relation need not be a direction, as it can be any relation that can be specified by a locational preposition such as <i>to</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>toward</i>, or <i>away from</i>. For example, the word <i>home</i> is itself a locative adverb in a sentence like "I took him home today" or "I found him home today"; in the former case, it is equivalent to the phrase "to home", and in the latter to the phrase "at home".
</p><p>Pro-form locative adverbs generally form a closed class and are particularly important in a language. Examples in English include <i>there</i> (meaning "at that place"), <i>whither</i> (= "to what place"), and <i>hence</i> (= "from this place"). As can be seen from the examples below, these anaphoric locative adverbs generally have a close relationship with the demonstratives (in English, <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>). They are also usually closely related to locative interrogative adverbs; in English, there is (or, at least, once was) a formal relationship between "where/there/here", "whither/thither/hither", and "whence/thence/hence".
