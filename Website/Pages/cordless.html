<p>The term <b>cordless</b> is generally used to refer to electrical or electronic devices that are powered by a battery or battery pack and can operate without a power cord or cable attached to an electrical outlet to provide mains power, allowing greater mobility.
The term "cordless" should not be confused with the term "<a href='wire.html'>wire</a>less", although it often is in common usage, possibly because some cordless devices (e.g., cordless telephones) are also <a href='wireless.html'>wireless</a>. The term "wireless" generally refers to devices that use some form of energy (e.g., <a href='radio.html'>radio</a> waves, infrared, ultrasonic, etc.) to transfer <i>information</i> or <i>commands</i> over a distance without the use of communication wires, regardless of whether the device gets its power from a power cord or a battery. The term "portable" is an even more general term and, when referring to electrical and electronic devices, usually means devices which are totally self-contained (e.g., have built-in power supplies, have no base unit, etc.) and which may also use wireless technology.
