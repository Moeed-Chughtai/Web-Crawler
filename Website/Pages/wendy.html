<p><b>Wendy</b> is a given name now generally given to girls in English-speaking countries.
</p><p>In Britain, Wendy appeared as a masculine name in a parish record in 1615. It was also used as a surname in Britain from at least the 17th century. Its popularity in Britain as a feminine name is owed to the character Wendy Darling from the 1904 play <i>Peter Pan</i> and its 1911 novelisation <i>Peter and Wendy</i> by J. M. Barrie. Its popularity reached a peak in the 1960s, and subsequently declined. The name was inspired by young Margaret Henley, daughter of Barrie's poet friend W. E. Henley. With the common childhood difficulty pronouncing <i>R</i>s, Margaret reportedly used to call him "my fwiendy-wendy".</p><p>Chinese women with the same or similar-sounding characters as their given names often anglicise their names as <i>Wendi</i> or <i>Wendy</i> (e.g. Wendi Deng, Wendy Kweh).
</p><p>In Germany after 1986, the name Wendy became popular because it is the name of a magazine (targeted specifically at young girls) about horses and horse riding.
