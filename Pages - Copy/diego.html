<p><b>Diego</b> is a Spanish given name. The Portuguese equivalent is <b>Diogo</b>.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The name has long been interpreted as reanalysis of <i>Santiago</i>, from older <i>Sant Yago</i> "Saint Jacob," in English known as Saint James, as <i>San-Tiago</i>.
This has been the standard interpretation of the name since at least the 19th century, it is so reported by Robert Southey (1808)
and by Apolinar Rato y Hevia  (1891).
The suggestion that this identification may be folk etymological, i.e. a name <i>Didacus</i>, <i>Diego</i> of unknown origin would at a later time have been identified with <i>Jacobo</i>, is made by Buchholtz (1894), even though this possibility is judged as improbable by the author himself.</p><p>In the later 20th century, the traditional identification of <i>Diego</i>=<i>Jacobo</i> has come to be seen as untenable. 
Malkiel (1975) calls the equation an "odd couple" (<i>extraña pareja</i>).
The name  <i>Didacus</i>, while unattested in antiquity, predates the earliest record of the form <i>Diego</i>. The oldest record for <i>Didacus</i> according to  Floriano (1949) dates to 747, with numerous further records during the 9th century.
Becker (2009) argues against  possible derivation from the Greek name <i>Diadochus</i>,
but also against suggestions of Basque and Celtic derivations.
</p><p><i>Didacus</i> is recorded in the forms <i>Diaco</i>, <i>Diago</i> in the 10th century.
The form <i>Diego</i> is first recorded in the late 11th century. Its original derivation from <i>Didacus</i> is uncertain, among other things because the shift from <i>-ía-</i> to <i>-ié-</i> is unexplained (Becker 2009:386).
The name <i>Diego Gonzalez</i> is given to a character in the Cantar de mio Cid, a poem of the 12th century.
It has been argued on metrical grounds that the name <i>Diego</i> in the <i>Cantar</i> represents an original <i>Díago</i>.</p><p>Medieval bearers of the name, such as Diego de Acebo (d. 1207), are recorded as <i>Didacus</i> in contemporary sources.
<i>Diego</i> becomes the standard form of the name in the 14th century, and it is frequently given in the 16th century, e.g. Diego Laynez,  1512–1565.
The city of San Diego was named for the flagship of Sebastián Vizcaíno (1602), which was itself named for Didacus of Alcalá (d. 1463).

<h2>Patronymics</h2>
<p>The patronymic for Diego is <i>Díaz</i> in Castillian (used for example by Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, better known as El Cid) and <i>Dias</i> in Portuguese. 
Like many patronymics, these have become common surnames in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking regions. The form <i>Diéguez</i> is much less common; <i>Diegues</i> can be found in Portuguese-speaking countries. <i>de Diego</i> and <i>Diego</i> can also be found as surnames.

<h2>Dago</h2>
<p>"Diego" as a generic name or term for a Spaniard is documented from around 1615.
The term  "Dago" as a generic name for Spaniards is recorded in the 19th century and may possibly be a derivation from <i>Diego</i>. 
By the early 20th century,  the term <i>dago</i> was extended as an ethnic slur applied chiefly to Italian Americans, besides also for anyone of Spanish or Portuguese descent.</p>
