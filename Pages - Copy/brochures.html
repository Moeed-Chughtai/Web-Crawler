<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A brochure is usually folded and only includes summary information that is promotional in character. A booklet is usually several sheets of paper with a card stock cover and bound with staples, string, or plastic binding.

<p>Brochures available in electronic format are called <i>e-brochures</i>. This format has the added benefit of unlimited distribution and cost savings when compared to traditional paper brochures.</p><p>The most common types of single-sheet brochures are the <i>bi-fold</i> (a single sheet printed on both sides and folded into halves) and the <i>tri-fold</i> (the same, but folded into thirds). A bi-fold brochure results in four panels (two panels on each side), while a tri-fold results in six panels (three panels on each side).</p><p>Other brochure fold arrangements are possible: the accordion or "z-fold" method, the "c-fold" method, etc. Larger sheets, such as those with detailed maps or expansive photo spreads, are folded into four, five, or six panels. When two card fascia are affixed to the outer panels of the z-folded brochure.

<h2>Marketing brochure<span id="Marketing"></span></h2>
<p>The term "<b>marketing brochure</b>" refers to a small document, or pamphlet, which describes and promotes various products or services to be marketed. Some companies have developed computer printing software to generate marketing brochures,
which might be available for use at a public library. However, it is common for a company to have a marketing brochure prepared by a professional printing company (or department) which has experience in creating such documents. As compared to a flyer or a handbill, a printed brochure usually has higher-quality paper and more color, and is folded or stapled at the seam.
</p><p>Because the goal of a marketing brochure is typically to assist in sales or distribution of products and services, the wording in the brochure is often very positive, with "glowing terms" to describe the features and benefits being offered. It is unlikely for a marketing brochure to list major complaints customers have stated about the products, in an effort to avoid any negative aspects about those products or services. The focus is typically on persuasion, to encourage people to want to obtain the items being described in the brochure.
</p><p>The term "marketing brochure" dates back many decades, such as for advertising new automobile features of the 1955 Ford Thunderbird.
