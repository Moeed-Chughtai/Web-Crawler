<p><b>Approx</b> is a caching proxy server for Debian archive files.
It is an HTTP-based proxy server for Debian-style package archives. It fetches files from remote repositories on demand, and caches them for local use.
</p>

<h2>Memory and time saver</h2>
<p>Approx can save time and network bandwidth if .deb packages need to be installed or upgraded for a number of machines on a local network. Each package is downloaded from a remote site only once, regardless of how many local clients install it. The approx cache typically requires a few gigabytes of disk space.
</p>

<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>Approx can simplify the administration of client machines; repository locations need only be changed in approx's configuration file, not in every client's /etc/apt/sources.list file.
</p>

<h2>Apt-proxy replacement</h2>
<p>Approx can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy, with no need to modify clients' /etc/apt/sources.list files, or as an alternative to apt-cacher."</p>
