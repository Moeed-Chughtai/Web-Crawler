<p><span lang="en" dir="ltr">The</span> <b>headline</b> or <b>heading</b> is the text indicating the nature of the article below it.
</p><p>The large type <i>front page headline</i> did not come into use until the late 19th century when increased competition between newspapers led to the use of attention-getting headlines.
</p><p>It is sometimes termed a news <i>hed</i>, a deliberate misspelling that dates from production flow during hot type days, to notify the composing room that a written note from an editor concerned a headline and should not be set in type.</p><p>Headlines in English often use a set of grammatical rules known as <i> headlinese</i>, designed to meet stringent space requirements by, for example, leaving out forms of the verb "to be" and choosing short verbs like "eye" over longer synonyms like "consider".
</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>A headline's purpose is to quickly and briefly draw attention to the story. It is generally written by a copy editor, but may also be written by the writer, the page layout designer, or other editors. The most important story on the front page above the fold may have a larger headline if the story is unusually important. <i>The New York Times</i><span>'s</span> 21 July 1969 front page stated, for example, that "MEN WALK ON MOON", with the four words in gigantic size spread from the left to right edges of the page.</p><p>In the United States, headline contests are sponsored by the American Copy Editors Society, the National Federation of Press Women, and many state press associations; some contests consider created content already published, others are for works written with winning in mind.</p>

<h2>Famous examples</h2>
<p>Some famous headlines in periodicals include:
</p>
<ul><li>WALL ST. LAYS AN EGG – <i>Variety</i> on Black Monday (1929)</li>
<li>STICKS NIX HICK PIX – <i>Variety</i> writing that rural moviegoers preferred urban films (1935)</li>

<li>MUSH FROM THE WIMP – <i>The Boston Globe</i> in-house joke headline for an editorial, which was not changed before 161,000 copies had been printed. Theo Lippman Jr. of the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> declared "Mush from the Wimp" the second most famous newspaper headline of the 20th century, behind "Wall St. Lays an Egg" and ahead of "Ford to City: Drop Dead".</li>

<li>WE ARE POPE (in German: Wir sind Papst); <i>Bild</i> after a German was voted to become Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.</li></ul><p><i>The New Republic</i> editor Michael Kinsley began a contest to find the most boring newspaper headline. According to him, no entry surpassed the one that had inspired him to create the contest: "WORTHWHILE CANADIAN INITIATIVE", over a column by <i>The New York Times</i><span>'</span> Flora Lewis.</p>

<h2>Typology</h2>
<p>Research in 1980 classified newspaper headlines into four broad categories: questions, commands, statements, and explanations. Advertisers and marketers classify advertising headlines slightly differently into questions, commands, benefits, news/information, and provocation.</p>

<h2>Headlinese</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">

<p><b>Headlinese</b> is an abbreviated form of news writing style used in newspaper headlines. Because space is limited, headlines are written in a compressed telegraphic style, using special syntactic conventions, including:
</p>
<ul><li>Forms of the verb "to be" and articles (<i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, <i>the</i>) are usually omitted.</li>
<li>Most verbs are in the simple present tense, e.g. "Governor signs bill", while the future is expressed by an infinitive, with <i>to</i> followed by a verb, as in "Governor to sign bill"</li>
<li>The conjunction "and" is often replaced by a comma, as in "Bush, Blair laugh off microphone mishap".</li>
<li>Individuals are usually specified by surname only, with no honorifics.</li>
<li>Organizations and institutions are often indicated by metonymy: "Wall Street" for the US financial sector, "Whitehall" for the UK government administration, "Madrid" for the government of Spain, "Davos" for World Economic Forum, and so on.</li>
<li>Many abbreviations, including contractions and acronyms, are used: in the US, some examples are <i>Dems</i> (for "Democrats") and <i>GOP</i> (for the Republican Party from the nickname "Grand Old Party"); in the UK, <i>Lib Dems</i> (for the Liberal Democrats), <i>Tories</i> (for the Conservative Party).  The period (full point) is usually omitted from these abbreviations, though <i>U.S.</i> may retain them, especially in all-caps headlines to avoid confusion with the word <i>us</i>.</li>
<li>Lack of a terminating full stop (period) even if the headline forms a complete sentence.</li>
<li>Use of single quotation marks to indicate a claim or allegation that cannot be presented as a fact. For example, an article titled "Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer'" covered a study which suggested a link but acknowledged that its findings were not definitive.  Linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum characterizes this practice as deceptive, noting that the single-quoted expressions in newspaper headlines are often not actual quotations, and sometimes convey a claim that is not supported by the text of the article. Another technique is to present the claim as a question, hence Betteridge's law of headlines.</li></ul><p>Some periodicals have their own distinctive headline styles, such as <i>Variety</i> and its entertainment-jargon headlines, most famously "Sticks Nix Hick Pix".

<h3>Commonly used short words</h3>
<p>To save space and attract attention, headlines often use extremely short words, many of which are not otherwise in common use, in unusual or idiosyncratic ways: </p>

<h2>Criticism</h2>
<h3>"Slam"</h3>
<p>The use of "slam" in headlines has attracted criticism on the grounds that the word is overused and contributes to media sensationalism. The violent imagery of words like "slam", "blast", "rip", and "bash" has drawn comparison to professional wrestling, where the primary aim is to titillate audiences with a conflict-laden and largely predetermined narrative rather than provide authentic coverage of spontaneous events.</p>

<h3>Crash blossoms</h3>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">
<p>"Crash blossoms" is a term used to describe headlines that have unintended ambiguous meanings, such as <i>The Times</i> headline "Hospitals named after sandwiches kill five". The word 'named' is typically used in headlines to mean "blamed/held accountable/named [in a lawsuit]", but in this example it seems to say that the hospitals' names were related to sandwiches. The headline was subsequently changed in the electronic version of the article to remove the ambiguity. The term was coined in August 2009 on the Testy Copy Editors web forum after the <i>Japan Times</i> published an article entitled "Violinist Linked to JAL Crash Blossoms" (since retitled to "Violinist shirks off her tragic image").</p>
