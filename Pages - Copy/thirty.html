<p><b>30</b> (<b>thirty</b>) is the natural number following 29 and preceding 31.
</p>

<h2>In mathematics</h2>
<p>30 is an even, composite, pronic number. With 2, 3 and 5 as its prime factors, it is a regular number, and the first sphenic number; the smallest of the form <span>2 × 3 × <i>r</i></span>, where <i>r</i> is a prime greater than 3. It has an aliquot sum of 42, which is the second sphenic number.
</p><p>It is also:
</p>
<ul><li>A semiperfect number, since adding some subsets of its divisors (e.g., 5, 10 and 15) equals 30.</li>
<li>A primorial.</li>
<li>A Harshad number in base 10.</li>
<li>Divisible by the number of prime numbers (10) below it.</li>
<li>The largest number such that all coprimes smaller than itself, except for 1, are prime.</li>
<li>The sum of the first four squares, which makes it a square pyramidal number.</li>
<li>The number of vertices in the Tutte–Coxeter graph.</li>
<li>The measure of the central angle and exterior angle of a dodecagon, which is the petrie polygon of the 24-cell.</li>
<li>The number of sides of a triacontagon, which in turn is the petrie polygon of the 120-cell and 600-cell.</li>
<li>The number of sides of a dodecahedron and icosahedron, of vertices of an icosidodecahedron, and of faces of a rhombic dodecahedron.</li>
<li>The sum of the number of elements of a 5-cell: 5 vertices, 10 edges, 10 faces, and 5 cells.</li>
<li>The Coxeter number of <i>E</i><sub>8</sub>.</li></ul><p>Furthermore,
</p><p>In a group <i>G</i> such that |<i>G</i>| = <i>p</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><i>m</i>, where <i>p</i> does not divide <i>m</i>, and has a subgroup of order <i>p</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>, 30 is the only number less than 60 that is neither a prime nor of the aforementioned form. Therefore, 30 is the only candidate for the order of a simple group less than 60 in-which one needs other methods to specifically reject to eventually deduce said order.

<h2>History and literature</h2>
<ul><li>At about age 30 (according to Luke 3:23), Jesus of Nazareth was baptized by John the Baptist, signaling the beginning of his public ministry of teaching and healing. It was also the age when David became King (2 Samuel 5:4) and Ezekiel and John the Baptist began their own ministries, (based on Ezekiel 1:1 and John the Baptist's age in comparison to Jesus.)</li>
<li>Age 30 is when Jewish priests traditionally start their service (according to Numbers 4:3).</li>
<li>One of the rallying-cries of the 1960s student/youth protest movement was the slogan, 'Don't trust anyone over thirty'.</li>
<li>In <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> the French existentialist Albert Camus comments that the age of thirty is a crucial  period in the life of a man, for at that age he gains a new awareness of the meaning of time.</li>
<li>In Franz Kafka's novel <i>The Trial</i> Joseph wakes up on the morning of his thirtieth birthday to find himself under arrest for an unspecified crime. After making many futile attempts to find the nature of the crime or the name of his accuser, Joseph dies on the eve of his thirty-first birthday.</li>

<li>Western Christianity's most prolific 20th-century essayist, F. W. Boreham in 'Life at Thirty' ('Cliffs of Opal') mentions that in addition to Jesus commencing ministry at 30 (Luke 3:23), Joseph was 30 when he stood before Pharaoh, King of Egypt (Genesis 41:46), King David was 30 when he began to reign (2 Samuel 5:4), and the Levites were numbered from the age of 30 and upward  (1 Chronicles 23:3). Also in that essay Boreham writes 'It was said of [the English poet] Keats, that "he ensphered himself in thirty perfect years and died, not young".'</li></ul>
