<p><i><b>The Biz</b></i> is an album by the American band the Sea and Cake, released in 1995. It was recorded at John McEntire's studio.</p>

<h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p><i>Trouser Press</i> stated: "Where most of Prekop's previous output shuffles, <i>The Biz</i> meanders; dynamic grooves give way to lazy jamming, hooks are outnumbered by pointless riffing and some of the mellower material would be right at home on a lite-rock radio station." The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> called the album "a stunning amalgam of infectious hooks and thoughtful experimentation."</p><p>AllMusic wrote: "A less structured record than previous efforts, <i>The Biz</i> is also the Sea and Cake's most subdued: songs like the title track, 'Station in the Valley' and 'Sending' are loose and languid, favoring a more jam-oriented and subconscious vibe over the taut dynamics of earlier work." <i>Paste</i> listed it as the 20th best indie rock album of 1995.</p>
