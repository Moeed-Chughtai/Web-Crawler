<p><b>Kenny</b> is a surname, a given name, and a diminutive of several different given names.
</p><p>In Ireland, the surname is an Anglicisation of the Irish <i><b>Ó Cionnaith</b></i>, also spelt <i><b>Ó Cionnaoith</b></i> and <i><b>Ó Cionaodha</b></i>, meaning "descendant of Cionnaith". It was once popular in the 16th-century in Leinster, Munster, parts of Connacht and in County Tyrone in Ulster, and was Anglicised as O'Kenna, O'Kenny, O'Kinney, Kenna, Kenny, and Kinney amongst other variations.</p><p>One bearer of the name was Cainnech of Aghaboe, better known in English as Saint Canice - a sixth-century Irish priest and missionary from near Dungiven, after whom the city and county of Kilkenny is also named.
