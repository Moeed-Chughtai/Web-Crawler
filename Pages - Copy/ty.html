<h3>First business-to-consumer Website</h3>
<p>Ty was the first business to produce a direct-to-consumer website designed to engage their market.  This is a major contributing factor to the early and rapidly growing popularity of Beanie Babies.  By the time the first iteration of the Ty Web site was published in late 1995, only 14% of Americans were using the Internet. In tandem with the launch of the Ty Website, all Beanie Baby hangtags had the Ty Website URL and a call to action printed underneath the poems and birthdays that commanded audiences to visit the company Web site with text that read: <i>Visit our web page!!!</i> As a result, consumers were visiting the Ty Web site by the thousands to gain information about Beanie Babies, which was completely unprecedented at the time. Ty was the first business to leverage their Web site to connect and engage with consumers of their products. This effort evolved into the world's first Internet sensation.</p>
