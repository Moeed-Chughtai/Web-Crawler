<p>A <b>prize</b> is an award to be given to a person or a group of people (such as sporting teams and organizations) to recognize and reward their actions and achievements. Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Academy Awards.
</p><p>Prizes are also given to publicize noteworthy or exemplary behaviour, and to provide incentives for improved outcomes and competitive efforts. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many  prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy.
