<p><b>Criticism</b> is the construction of a judgement about the positive and negative qualities of someone or something. Criticism can range from impromptu comments to a written detailed response. Criticism falls into several overlapping types including "theoretical, practical, impressionistic, affective, prescriptive, or descriptive"<i>.</i>
</p><p>Criticism may also refer to an expression of disapproval. When criticism of this nature is constructive it can make an individual aware of gaps in their understanding and it can provide distinct routes for improvement. Research supports the notion that using feedback and constructive criticism in the learning process is very influential.</p><p><b>Critique vs criticism</b> In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and 'criticism'. The two words both translate as <i>critique</i>, <i>Kritik</i>, and <i>critica</i>, respectively. In the English language, philosopher Gianni Vattimo suggests that <i>criticism</i> is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism while <i>critique</i> refers to more general and profound writing as Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. Another distinction that is sometimes made is that <i>critique</i> is never personalized nor <i>ad hominem</i> and is presented in a way that encourages rebuttal or expansion of the ideas expressed. Nonetheless, the distinctions are subtle and ambiguous at best.</p><p>The term "<i>brickbat</i>" is sometimes used to mean "an unfavourable criticism, unkind remark or sharp put-down". The term originated in the 17th century, derived from the practice of throwing bricks as projectiles at a person who was disapproved of.</p>

<h2>Criticism in Academia</h2>
<p>Critical Studies and Critical Theory programs teach the method of critique, also known as “criticism.” Both theory and studies programs often sample new works in addition to the classical texts.  UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Northwestern University offer programs in Critical Theory, while a number of other colleges and universities offer programs or sole courses in Critical Studies, Critical Theory, and sub-disciplines. Sub-disciplines include Critical Race Studies, Critical Asian Studies, Critical Black Studies, and Critical Disability Studies.  The term “critical” can be found in course titles concerning a variety of topics, as the term refers to a method or approach to course materials.
</p><p>Some claim “critical” studies have a particular focus in their perspective or opinion, confusing the method of critique with individual critiques. The recent appearance of “critical” studies and theory further compounds the conflation of particular authors with the new method and discipline. Additionally, the method and disciplines are distinguished from analysis or traditional objectivist or hard sciences by their allowances for subjectivity in the perspective of the author.
