<p><b>Evening</b> is the period of a day from the end of the afternoon to the beginning of night. The exact times when evening begins and ends depend on location, time of year, and culture, but it is generally regarded as beginning when the Sun is low in the sky and lasting until the end of twilight. Depending on the speaker, it may start as early as 5 or 6<span> </span>pm, and to last until night. It may be used colloquially to include the last waning afternoon shortly before sunset.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word is derived from Eve, which originated from <i>æfnian</i> meaning "become evening, grow toward evening". The Old English <i>æfnian</i> originated from <i>æfen</i> (eve), which meant "the time between sunset and darkness", and was synonymous with even (Old English <i>æfen</i>) which meant the end of the day. The use of "evening" dates from the mid 15th century.</p>
