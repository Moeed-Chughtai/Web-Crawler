<p>The name <b>Kay</b> is found both as a surname (see Kay (surname)) and as a given name. In English-speaking countries, it is usually a feminine name, often a short form of Katherine or one of its variants; but it is also used as a first name in its own right, and also as a masculine name (for example in India, the Netherlands, and Sweden). The alternative spelling of Kaye is encountered as a surname, but also occasionally as a given name: for instance, actress Kaye Ballard.
