<p><i>Q</i> began as a music magazine published monthly in the United Kingdom. Originally it was to be called Cue (named after the act of cueing a record to play).

<h5><i>Kerrang!</i></h5>
<p><i>Kerrang!</i> is a brand that specialises in rock music. It was originally a magazine with Kerrang! Radio being launched in 2004.
