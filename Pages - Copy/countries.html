<p>A <b>country</b> or <b>state</b> (sometimes called <b>nation</b>) is a distinct territorial body or political entity.  It may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.
</p><p>The largest country is Russia, while the smallest is the microstate Vatican City. The Pitcairn Islands is the least populous, while the most populous is China.
</p>

<h2>Etymology and usage</h2>
<p>The word <i>country</i> comes from Old French <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">contrée</i></span>, which derives from Vulgar Latin (<span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">terra</i></span>) <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">contrata</i></span> ("(land) lying opposite"; "(land) spread before"), derived from <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">contra</i></span> ("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after the Franco-Norman invasion during the 11th century.
</p><p>In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the indefinite article – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a synonym for state, or a former sovereign state, in the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land". An example of this in North America is Navajo Country.
</p><p>Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the West Country in England, the "big country" (used in various contexts of the American West), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.</p><p>The equivalent terms in various Romance languages (e.g. the French <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">pays</i></span>) have not carried the process of being identified with sovereign political states as far as the English <i>country</i>. These terms are derived from the Roman term <span title="Latin-language text"><i lang="la">pagus</i></span>, which continued to be used in the Middle Ages for small geographical areas similar to the size of English counties. In many European countries, the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German <span title="German-language text"><i lang="de">Bundesländer</i></span>, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many "<span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">pays</i></span>" that are officially recognised at some level and are either natural regions, like the Pays de Bray, or reflect old political or economic entities, like the Pays de la Loire.
</p><p>A version of "country" can be found in modern French as <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">contrée</i></span>, derived from the Old French word <span title="Old French (842-ca. 1400)-language text"><i lang="fro">cuntrée</i></span>, that is used similarly to the word <span title="French-language text"><i lang="fr">pays</i></span> to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian <span title="Italian-language text"><i lang="it">contrada</i></span> is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a ward or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

<h2>Country names</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">
<p>Countries may be known by two names: a protocol, formal, full, or official name; and a geographical, common, or short name.</p>

<h2>Country symbols</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"><p>Symbols of a country indicate cultural, religious or political symbol of any nation or race the country consists of. There are many categories of symbols which can be seen in flags, coat of arms or seals. 
</p><ul><li>Flags</li>
<li>Coats of arms or national emblems</li>
<li>Seals or stamps</li>
<li>National mottos</li>
<li>National colours</li>
<li>National anthems</li></ul>

<h2>Sovereignty status</h2>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096">
<p>The term "country" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. By one application of the declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood, there are 206 sovereign states; of which 193 are members of the UN, two have observer status at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UNGA.
</p><p>The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own.  They are listed together alongside sovereign states on lists of countries, and many are treated as a separate "country of origin" in international trade as the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong are.</p><p>A few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries, such as the Danish Realm, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, France, the Realm of New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Country classification</h2>
<p>Several organisations seek to identify trends to produce country classifications. Countries are often distinguished as developing countries or developed countries.
</p>

<h3>The United Nations</h3>
<p>The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the <i>World Economic Situation and Prospects Report</i> classifies states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income (GNI). The UN identifies subgroups within the broad categories based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies like Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognises only developed countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.
</p><p>The UN additionally recognises multiple trends that impact the developmental status of countries in the <i>World Economic Situation and Prospects</i>. The report highlights fuel-exporting and fuel-importing countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. It also identifies heavily indebted developing countries.</p><p>The newest United Nations (UN) member is South Sudan.</p>

<h3>The World Bank</h3>
<p>The World Bank also classifies countries based on GNI per capita. The <i>World Bank Atlas method</i> classifies countries as low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower-middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper-middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.</p><p>It also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.
