<p>An <b>entity</b> is something that exists as itself, as a subject or as an object, actually or potentially, concretely or abstractly, physically or not. It need not be of material existence. In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is animate, or present.
</p><p>The term is broad in scope and may refer to animals; natural features such as mountains; inanimate objects such as tables; numbers or sets as symbols written on a paper; human contrivances such as laws, corporations and academic disciplines; or supernatural beings such as gods and spirits.
</p><p>The adjectival form is <i>entitative</i>.
</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word <i>entity</i> is derived from the Latin <i>entitas</i>, which in turn derives from the Latin <i>ens</i> meaning "being" or "existing" (compare English <i>essence</i>). <i>Entity</i> may hence literally be taken to mean "thing which exists".
