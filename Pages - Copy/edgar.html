<p><b>Edgar</b> is a commonly used English given name, from an Anglo-Saxon name <i>Eadgar</i> (composed of <i>ead</i>   "rich, prosperous" and <i>gar</i>  "spear").
Like most Anglo-Saxon names, it fell out of use by the later medieval period; it was, however, revived in the 18th century, and was popularised by its use for a character in Sir Walter Scott's <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> (1819).
