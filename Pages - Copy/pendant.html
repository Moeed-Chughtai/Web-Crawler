<p>A <b>pendant</b> is a loose-hanging piece of jewellery, generally attached by a small loop to a necklace, which may be known as a "pendant necklace". A pendant earring is an earring with a piece hanging down.  Its name stems from the Latin word <i>pendere</i> and Old French word <i>pendr</i>, both of which translate to "to hang down". In modern French, <i>pendant</i> is the gerund form of <i>pendre</i> ("to hang") and also means "during". The extent to which the design of a pendant can be incorporated into an overall necklace makes it not always accurate to treat them as separate items.</p><p>In some cases, though, the separation between necklace and pendant is far clearer.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Pendants are among the oldest recorded types of bodily adornment. Stone, shell, pottery, and more perishable materials were used. Ancient Egyptians commonly wore pendants, some shaped like hieroglyphs.
</p><p>Pendants can have several functions, which may be combined:

<ul><li>Award (i.e., Scouting Ireland Chief Scout's Award, Order of CúChulainn)</li>
<li>Identification (i.e., religious symbols, sexual symbols, symbols of rock bands)</li>
<li>Ornamentation</li>
<li>Ostentation (i.e., jewels).</li>
<li>Protection (i.e., amulets, religious symbols)</li>
<li>Self-affirmation (i.e., initials, names)</li></ul><p>The many specialized types of pendants include lockets which open, often to reveal an image, and pendilia, which hang from larger objects of metalwork.

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Throughout the ages, pendants have come in a variety of forms to serve a variety of purposes.
</p>

<h3>Amulet</h3>
<p>Though amulets come in many forms, a wearable amulet worn around the neck or on the arm or leg in the form of a pendant is the most common. These are objects believed to possess magical or spiritual power to protect the wearer from danger or dispel evil influences.</p>

<h3>Talisman</h3>
<p>Similar to an amulet, a talisman is an object believed to possess supernatural traits. However, while an amulet is strictly a defensive object, a talisman is meant to confer special benefits or powers upon the wearer.</p>

<h3>Locket</h3>
<p>A locket is a small object that opens to reveal a space which serves to hold a small object, usually a photograph or a curl of hair. They typically come in the form of a pendant hanging from a necklace, though they will occasionally be hung from a charm bracelet.</p>

<h3>Medallion</h3>
<p>A medallion is most often a coin-shaped piece of metal worn as a pendant around the neck or pinned onto clothing. These are generally granted as awards, recognitions, or religious blessings.</p>

<h3>Painting</h3>

<h3>Functional pendants</h3>
<p>Tools worn as pendants include Maori pounamu pendants. Shepherd's whistles, bosun's whistles, and ocarinas can also be made as pendants. Portable astronomical and navigational instruments were made as pendants. 
</p><p>In the first decade of the 21st century, jewellers started to incorporate USB flash drives into pendants.</p>

<h3>Fashion pendants</h3>
<p>Fashion pendants include a small creative piece often made from precious or non-precious stones and metals like diamonds or pearls hanging freely from a chain or necklace. These are generally worn as a statement piece or a fashion ornament.
