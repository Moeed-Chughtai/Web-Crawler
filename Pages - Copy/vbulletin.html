<h2>History</h2>
<p>vBulletin was first launched in 2000. Its successor, vBulletin 2, was released in 2001. A third version was launched in 2004.
</p><p>Internet Brands acquired the product from JelSoft in 2007.</p><p>vBulletin 4 was released in late 2009. The StyleVars system was added to draw CSS variables directly from the vBulletin Template code.</p><p>In July 2010, the BBC reported that there was a serious flaw in vBulletin software that allows anyone to easily access the database username and password.</p><p>In October 2010, Internet Brands sued three former employees, just as their new competing software XenForo was to be launched, as well as a second lawsuit in the United States claiming breach of contract, copyright infringement, and misappropriation of trade secrets. In May 2011 it was announced that vBulletin had abandoned an attempt at preventing XenForo doing business, and in 2013 the claims were dismissed.
</p><p>vBulletin 5 was released in 2012.
</p><p>In late 2017, a post by Technical Support Lead, Wayne Luke, confirmed that vBulletin 3 and vBulletin 4 were now considered to be "End of Life" software, with no further development of the series planned.</p>
