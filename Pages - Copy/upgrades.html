<h2>Production and release</h2>
<p>In the scene in "Divide and Conquer" that flashes back to the events in Upgrades, where Carter and O'Neill are trapped on opposite sides of the forcefield, lines were written but the actors chose not to say them. In "Watergate", melted toxic wax was used to give Maybourne a frozen look. Tom McBeath couldn't breathe it in or would have risked his own health. The actual ending of the episode where O'Neill proposes that the two races had just exchanged hostages was not the intended ending, which is why the episode appears to end so abruptly. In "Beneath the Surface", Thera and Jonah were supposed to kiss to confirm that they were in a relationship, but this was dropped because O'Neill had already kissed Carter earlier in the season in "Window of Opportunity".</p><p>"Chain Reaction" made many references to the movie <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. As Lecter does with Clarice in the movie, Harry Maybourne refers to <i>quid pro quo</i>, should O'Neill really want to get help from him. Another reference is the final telephonic conversation between O'Neill and Maybourne, the latter calling from an exotic place, just as Lecter called Clarice Starling at the end of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. "Double Jeopardy" is the only <i>Stargate SG-1</i> episode directed by actor Michael Shanks. This episode serves as a sequel to the Season 1 episode "Tin Man", where the robotic SG-1 team first appeared. The artificial Daniel Jackson wears a bandana covering his hair, as he was created when Daniel (and Shanks) had long hair. "Exodus" is the last season finale that ends on a cliffhanger until Season Nine's "Camelot".
