<p>In law and politics, treating is the act of serving food, drink, and other refreshments to influence people for political gain, often shortly before an election. In various countries, treating is considered a form of corruption, and is illegal as such.  However, as long as the supplying of refreshments is not part of a <i>quid pro quo</i> for votes, etc., it is often not illegal.
