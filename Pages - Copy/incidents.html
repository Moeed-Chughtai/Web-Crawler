<p><i><b>Incidents</b></i> is a 1987 collection of four essays by Roland Barthes. It was published posthumously by François Wahl, Barthes' literary executor.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the first essay, <i>La Lumiere du Sud-Ouest</i>, first published in <i>L'Humanité</i> in 1977, Roland Barthes reflects on the South West of France, the Adour and Bayonne. The second essay, <i>Incidents</i>, written in 1969, details Barthes's holiday in Morocco, where he pays men and boys for sex. In <i>Au Palace Ce Soir</i>, the third essay, first published in issue 10 of <i>Vogue-Hommes</i> in May 1978, Barthes describes Le Palace, a fashionable theatre-house in Paris. The fourth essay, <i>Soirées de Paris</i>, is a diary from August to September 1979, where Roland Barthes admits to using male escorts as all his relationships have been disappointing to him.

<h2>Literary significance and criticism</h2>
<p>Although critics have questioned whether Roland Barthes intended to publish <i>Incidents</i> and <i>Soirées de Paris</i>, it has been argued that they have informed our reading of Barthes's oeuvre because of their explicit revelations of his homosexuality. Drawing upon these essays, D.A. Miller, in <i>Bringing Out Roland Barthes</i>, re-reads Barthes's oeuvre through a gay lens.</p><p>The essay <i>Incidents</i> has been compared to André Gide's <i>Amyntas</i> with its pastoral theme, although Gide writes about Tunisia and Algeria rather than Morocco. It has also been compared to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>.</p>
