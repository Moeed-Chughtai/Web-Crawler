<h2>History</h2>
<p>The company was founded in 1994 as <i>Scottish Power Telecommunications Holdings Ltd</i> (trading as <i>Scottish Telecom</i>), an offshoot of the energy company Scottish Power.  In 1998 the company acquired Demon Internet. Rod Matthews, who had founded the business, remained as Chief Executive until 1999.</p>
