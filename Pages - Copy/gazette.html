<p>A <b>gazette</b> is an official journal, a newspaper of record, or simply a newspaper.
</p><p>In English and French speaking countries, newspaper publishers have applied the name <i>Gazette</i> since the 17th century; today, numerous weekly and daily newspapers bear the name <i>The Gazette</i>.
</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p><i>Gazette</i> is a loanword from the French language, which is, in turn, a 16th-century permutation of the Italian <i>gazzetta</i>, which is the name of a particular Venetian coin. <i>Gazzetta</i> became an epithet for <i>newspaper</i> during the early and middle 16th century, when the first Venetian newspapers cost one gazzetta. (Compare with other vernacularisms from publishing lingo, such as the British <i>penny dreadful</i> and the American <i>dime novel</i>.) This loanword, with its various corruptions, persists in numerous modern languages (Slavic languages, Turkic languages).

<p>In England, with the 1700 founding of <i>The Oxford Gazette</i> (which became the <i>London Gazette</i>), the word <i>gazette</i> came to indicate a public journal of the government; today, such a journal is sometimes called a government gazette. For some governments, publishing information in a gazette was or is a legal necessity by which official documents come into force and enter the public domain. Such is the case for documents published in <i>Royal Thai Government Gazette</i> (est. 1858), and in <i>The Gazette of India</i> (est. 1950).
</p><p>The government of the United Kingdom requires government gazettes of its member countries. Publication of the <i>Edinburgh Gazette</i>, the official government newspaper in Scotland, began in 1699. The <i>Dublin Gazette</i> of Ireland followed in 1705, but ceased when the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922; the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> (Irish: <i>Official Gazette</i>) replaced it. The <i>Belfast Gazette</i> of Northern Ireland published its first issue in 1921.

<h2><i>Gazette</i> as a verb</h2>
<p>Chiefly in British English, the transitive verb <i>to gazette</i> means "to announce or publish in a gazette"; especially where <i>gazette</i> refers to a public journal or a newspaper of record. For example, "Lake Nakuru was gazetted as a bird sanctuary in 1960 and upgraded to National Park status in 1968." British Army personnel decorations, promotions, and officer commissions are gazetted in the <i>London Gazette</i>, the "Official Newspaper of Record for the United Kingdom". <i>Gazettal</i> (a noun) is the act of gazetting; for example, "the gazettal of the bird sanctuary".</p>
