<p><b>Miss</b> (pronounced <span></span>) is an English language honorific typically used for an unmarried woman (when not using another title such as "Doctor" or "Dame"), or of a married woman retaining her maiden name. Originating in the 17th century, it is a contraction of <i>mistress</i>. Its counterparts are Mrs., used for a married women who has taken her husband's name, and Ms., which can be used for married or unmarried women.
</p><p>The plural <i><b>Misses</b></i> may be used, such as in <i>The Misses Doe</i>. The traditional French "<b>Mademoiselle</b>" (abbreviation "<b>Mlle</b>") may also be used as the plural in English language conversation or correspondence. In Australian, British, and Irish schools the term 'miss' is often used by pupils in addressing any female teacher.

<h2>Use alone as a form of address</h2>
<p><i>Miss</i> is an honorific for addressing a woman who is not married, and is known by her maiden name. It is a shortened form of <i>mistress</i>, and departed from <i>misses/missus</i> which became used to signify marital attachment in the 18th and 19th centuries. It does not imply age, though youth corresponds (as marriage implies adulthood).
</p><p>Those seeking to diminish the importance of marriage status to a woman's social identity began to appropriate the office expedience of <i>Ms.</i> (unpunctuated in the UK) in the early 1970s, when it rose 700%. In formal correspondence as women entered the workforce, <i>Ms.</i> pronounced "mizz," served/serves some conservative social functions in avoiding unpleasantness where a woman might keep a marriage name after a divorce, or where the interpersonal gaffe of failing to acknowledge the important marriage event might cause offense (or indicate junior authorship of correspondence).
