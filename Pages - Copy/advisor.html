<p>An <b>adviser</b> or <b>advisor</b> is normally a person with more and deeper knowledge in a specific area and usually also includes persons with cross-functional and multidisciplinary expertise. An adviser's role is that of a mentor or guide and differs categorically from that of a task-specific consultant. An adviser is typically part of the leadership, whereas consultants fulfill functional roles.</p><p>The spellings <i>adviser</i> and <i>advisor</i> have both been in use since the 16th century. <i>Adviser</i> has always been the more usual spelling, though <i>advisor</i> has gained frequency in recent years and is a common alternative, especially in North America.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The use of <i><b>adviser</b></i> is of English origin, with "er" as a noun ending, and <i><b>advisor</b></i> of Latin origin. The words are etymological twin cognates and are considered interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Word usage</h2>
