<p>A <b>diploma</b> is a certification, deed, or document awarded by an educational institution (such as a college or university) testifying the recipient has graduated by successfully completing their courses of studies. Historically, it has also referred to a charter or official document of diplomacy.</p><p>The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a <b>testamur</b>, Latin for "we testify" or "certify" (testari), so called from the word with which the certificate begins; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a degree.  Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a <b>parchment</b>. The certificate that a Nobel laureate receives is also called a diploma.
</p><p>The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a King affirming a grant or tenure of specified land and its conditions (see Anglo-Saxon Charters and Diplomatics).

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Australia</h3>
<p>In Australia, there are three varieties of Diploma currently recognized by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF):
</p>
<ul><li>a "Diploma", a qualification granted by vocational education and training (VET) sector or university. It is typically completed with 12 to 18 months of full-time study. When accepted for credit as part of a bachelor's degree, it is usually deemed to be equivalent to the first year of the degree.</li>
<li>an "Advanced Diploma", which is equivalent to an Australian "Associate Degree" and is equivalent to the second year of a bachelor's degree.</li>
<li>a "Graduate Diploma", which is undertaken after completing a bachelor's degree (or being deemed to have equivalent knowledge). This can be in a field other than that covered by said degree (e.g., the Graduate Diploma of Education necessary to become a school teacher in most Australian states). It can also be a coursework-only qualification undertaken as additional study in a specialisation within one's degree area.</li></ul><p>The "Vocational Graduate Diploma" was a short lived AQF qualification equivalent to the "Graduate Diploma", intended to be delivered exclusively in the VET sector. On January 1, 2015, all such qualifications being offered lost the word "Vocational" from their title.</p>

<h3>Canada</h3>
<p>In Ontario, Canada, diplomas are two and three year academic post-secondary programmes taught by colleges and institutes of applied studies, arts, and technology. Two year programmes are referred to as college diplomas, while three year programmes are called Ontario College Advanced Diplomas. Baccalaureate degrees in Ontario are commonly a year longer than an Advanced Diploma and are offered by both colleges and universities.
The Canadian school system uses credits to calculate the value of a course load towards a diploma.  To graduate and earn a diploma, the school decides how many credits each course contributes towards the diploma.  For example, one college course delivered over 14 weeks of a semester counts for 3 credits. towards the 60 credits for a complete 2 year program.

</p>

<h3>United Kingdom</h3>
<p>In the UK, <i>diploma</i> can refer to several different types of qualification but is never equivalent to a degree. A degree is higher than a diploma. One can never say that he finished a degree when he is only given a special diploma. A Diploma can be a qualification worth 37 or more credits on the Regulated Qualifications Framework, e.g. Entry Level Diploma, Level 3 Diploma. The Diploma of Higher Education is a higher education award equivalent to the second-year of a bachelor's degree. The Higher National Diploma is a vocational qualification at the same level. A Graduate Diploma is a one-year qualification at bachelor's degree level, normally taken by those who have already obtained a degree. A Postgraduate Diploma is an award at the level of a master's degree, but normally taking less time to complete.</p><p>Some universities may offer other qualifications, such as the University of Cambridge's and the University of Oxford's Undergraduate Diploma (a 1-year, part-time course at the same level as a Diploma of Higher Education) and Undergraduate Advanced Diploma.
</p><p>The document certifying the award of a degree is normally called a degree certificate in the UK, and details are printed in English, not in Latin.</p>

<h4>Undergraduate Advanced Diploma</h4>
<p>The Undergraduate Advanced Diploma (UGAdvDip or UGAD) is a FHEQ Level 6 award, the academic level is the equivalent to the final year of a bachelor's degree and they are generally accepted as equivalent to a Bachelor's degree or a Graduate Diploma. An advanced diploma is an undergraduate degree that prepares students to enter into a specific career or further study in an advanced degree, like a Master of Arts. After graduated from an Undergraduate Advanced Diploma, it enables student to apply for postgraduate studies such as Master's degree or Postgraduate Diploma. Even though they are considered equivalent to a Bachelor's degree they usually have a duration of two years and they can be offered both on a full time and a part time basis. Students are eligible to apply for College Membership and they are considered alumni of the universities they attended.

<h3>United States</h3>
<p>In the United States, the word <i>diploma</i> usually refers to the actual document, especially in the context of academic degrees earned at the college or university level.  That is, Americans normally draw a distinction between a diploma as documentary evidence of the award of an academic degree, and the underlying degree itself (which is not called a diploma).
</p><p>The reason this distinction matters is that many American universities do not print diplomas until several weeks or months <i>after</i> the dates on which graduates were formally awarded their degrees on their academic transcripts.  In other words, when a diploma says on its face that so-and-so degree was "given at [city] on [date]", the diploma itself was not physically handed to the holder on that date.  (For ceremonial purposes, the documents handed out at graduation are simply certificates of participation in the graduation ceremony itself.)  Thus, asking alumni when they received their diplomas is usually pointless; what really matters for most purposes (e.g., occupational licensing) is when they received their degrees.  This important distinction can lead to some confusion when persons who obtained degrees at American universities are presenting their academic credentials in other countries.</p><p>There are two major exceptions where Americans have merged the document with the qualification it represents (as seen in other countries). The first is the high school diploma.  Second, the term "diploma" can refer to a specific academic or training award. For example, the Diploma in Nursing was offered by hospital-based nursing schools.
</p><p>Historically, American universities emulated their European counterparts by issuing diplomas written in the Latin language. That is now the exception today: "While most colleges and universities now issue English diplomas, some prominent holdouts  including Yale, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania  still use Latin."  At Harvard University, undergraduate degrees began to be written in English in 1961, leading to a street protest by students known as the "Diploma Riots".  However, as of 2021, some Harvard graduate schools continue to issue degrees in Latin, including Harvard Law School and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
</p><p>The term <i>diplomate</i> (always ending with an <i>e</i>) is used in the United States to refer to a person holding a specialized certification in a professional field, although the documentary evidence of this is traditionally called a "certificate" and not a "diploma". For example, board-certified physicians in the United States traditionally indicate their board-certified status on their letterhead and business cards with the title "Diplomate", a comma, and then the name of their certifying board.

<h3>International</h3>
<p>The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma is a pre-university qualification normally taken by students in the final two years of high school.</p>
