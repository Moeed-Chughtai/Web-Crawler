<p>A <b>handbook</b> is a type of reference work, or other collection of instructions, that is intended to provide ready reference. The term originally applied to a small or portable book containing information useful for its owner, but the Oxford English Dictionary defines the current sense as "any book...giving information such as facts on a particular subject, guidance in some art or occupation, instructions for operating a machine, or information for tourists."</p><p>A handbook is sometimes referred to as a <i><b>vade mecum</b></i> (Latin, "go with me") or <b>pocket reference</b>. It may also be referred to as an enchiridion.
</p><p>Handbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of information in a particular field or about a particular technique. They are designed to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. For example, the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers is a reference for how to cite works in MLA style, among other things. Examples of engineering handbooks include <i>Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook</i>, <i>Marks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers</i>, and the <i>CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</i>.
