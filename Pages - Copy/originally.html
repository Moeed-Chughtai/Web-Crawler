<h2>Reception</h2>
<p>AllMusic awarded the album 2 stars stating "This LP contains valuable performances by the early Jazz Messengers that sat unissued until decades later.... Although not an essential set, Art Blakey fans will find this album to be a valuable gapfiller in the history of The Jazz Messengers".</p>
